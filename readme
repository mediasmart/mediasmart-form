# Mediasmart Form

This is a simple component for complex forms. If you use React and need a form, this is what you need.

## Usage

Using this component from your app is really simple:

```javascript
import MediasmartForm from 'mediasmart-form'

...
const FIELDS = [
  // to be completed
];
...
<MediasmartForm fields={FIELDS} />
...
```

TO BE COMPLETED

## Development

During the development of this component, just keep the build server and the example app running, so any change is hot-reloaded:

```
# Terminal 1
npm start
```

```
# Terminal 2
cd example
npm start
```

Instead of keeping the build server running you can build the component directly:

```
npm run build
```
